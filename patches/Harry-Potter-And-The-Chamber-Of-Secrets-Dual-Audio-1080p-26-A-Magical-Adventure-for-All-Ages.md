In this movie, Harry Potter receives a warning from a mysterious house-elf named Dobby, who tells him not to return to Hogwarts. Harry ignores the warning and goes back to school with his best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. However, he soon discovers that something sinister is happening at Hogwarts. A mysterious message appears on the wall, announcing that the Chamber of Secrets has been opened. Students and staff are attacked by a mysterious creature, and Harry hears a strange voice in his head.
  
Harry, Ron and Hermione decide to investigate the mystery of the Chamber of Secrets, and discover that it is a hidden part of the school that was created by one of the founders, Salazar Slytherin. Slytherin was a wizard who hated Muggle-borns (wizards and witches who have non-magical parents), and wanted to purge them from the school. He left behind a monster that only his heir can control, and that can kill anyone who looks into its eyes.
  
Harry suspects that Draco Malfoy, a rival student from Slytherin House, might be the heir of Slytherin. He also learns that he can speak Parseltongue, the language of snakes, which is a rare and dark ability. Harry wonders if he has any connection to Slytherin, and if he is the one who opened the Chamber of Secrets.
  
As the attacks continue, Harry decides to enter the Chamber of Secrets and face the monster. He is aided by his loyal friends, his mentor Professor Dumbledore, and a magical diary that belongs to a mysterious person named Tom Riddle. Harry will have to use all his courage and magic to save his friends and the school from the dark power that lurks in the chamber.
